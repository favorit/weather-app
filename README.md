# Weather App

Enjoy my beautiful Weather App :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Future improvements:

1. Remove .env from the repo for security reasons.
2. Design aka version 0.1 <3
3. Accessibility.
4. Add more unit and integration tests.
5. Optimize requests to the WeatherAPI. 
5. Enreach User Settings (kph/mph).
6. Fetch user location as default Weather Info.
7. Store User Settings in React Context to access in different parts of the app without drilling props.  
8. and many many more :)
